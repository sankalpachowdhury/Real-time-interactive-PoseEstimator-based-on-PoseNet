# Real-time-interactive-PoseEstimator-based-on-PoseNet

##***Part 1:*** 


Pose estimation using PoseNet pretrained model and calling it through ml5.js


1. We have used the PoseNet pretrained model for this project.

2. The posenet model is called through ml5.js

3. Online javascript web editor called P5.js is used as the web editor.

4. Pose Estimation is done in the stapes.




*Image -----> PoseNet -----> Array of (x,y) coordinates -----> Confidence Score '%'*



**Steps for building a Realtime Pose Estimator in the browser is given below**

1. Call the 'ml5.min.js' dependencies from the index.html file.
2. Define the Window size and all backgrounds.
3. Define the css Style for the project in style.css file.
4. Follow along the steps in the sketch.js file.

    step 1: 
    Referance to ml5 PoseNet Liberary and include arguments : video and modelLoaded 
    This should be called steup() function
    
    step 2:
